## Learning experiences


### Exercises

Each block has practical work involved. Some more than others. The practicals are subdivided into chapters, and we'll have a (short) discussion after each chapter. All answers to the practicals are incorporated, but they are hidden. Do the exercise first by yourself, before checking out the answer. If your answer is different from the answer in the practicals, try to figure out why they are different.

### Asking questions
During lectures, you are encouraged to raise your hand if you have questions (if in-person), or use the Zoom functionality (if online):

A main source of communication will be our [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ngsqualitycon-c8g5456/shared_invite/zt-hwth7xrb-vYpga8sUye_7Ij9x6OkyKA). Ask background questions that interest you personally at **#background**. During the exercises, e.g. if you are stuck or don't understand what is going on, use the slack channel **#peer-q-and-a**.  This channel is not only meant for asking questions but also for answering questions of other participants. Answer questions only if you have finished the practical block, and use the "reply in thread" option:

The teacher will review the answers, and add/modify if necessary. If you're stuck and need tutor support, use the *no* button in Zoom, if you're finished use the *yes* button.

**To summarize:**

* During lectures: raise hand/zoom functionality
* Personal interest questions: **#background**
* During exercises:

    * **\#peer_q_and_a** on slack
    * if really stuck: *no* button in zoom
    * if finished: *yes* button in zoom
